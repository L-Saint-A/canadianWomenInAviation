                <h2>why we exist</h2>
                <p>It's hard to ignore the voices that make you feel like you're not enough. That's
                    where we can help. We've got just the secret family recipe to help you get past
                    the nay-saying and get you to your dreams: a crew that gets you.<br>
                    We're more than bold women reaching for the stars and going where they're
                    told not to. We're bigger than women breaking barriers in aviation. We're ev-
                    eryday people with highs and lows, successes and failures, good days and bad
                    days.<br>
                    Forget the mold, because here, you'll fit in just fine. It's time to start looking at imperfect as “I'm Perfect”.<br>
                    We're here to help you take off, guide you to safe landings and get you through
                    the turbulence during your flight ahead.<br>
                    Nothing in aviation happens without a crew.</p>
