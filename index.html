                <h2>why we exist</h2>
                <p>It's hard to ignore the voices that make
                    you feel like you're not enough. That's
                    where we can help. We've got just the
                    secret family recipe to help you get past
                    the nay-saying and get you to your
                    dreams: a crew that gets you.<br>
                    We're more than bold women reaching
                    for the stars and going where they're
                    told not to. We're bigger than women
                    breaking barriers in aviation. We're ev-
                    eryday people with highs and lows, suc-
                    cesses and failures, good days and bad
                    days.<br>
                    Forget the mold, because here, you'll fit
                    in just fine. It's time to start looking at
                    imperfect as “I'm Perfect”.<br>
                    We're here to help you take off, guide
                    you to safe landings and get you through
                    the turbulence during your flight ahead.<br>
                    Nothing in aviation happens without a
                    crew.</p>
